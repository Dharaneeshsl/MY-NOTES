Logical Thinking

Okay, here are full notes from all of the provided video transcripts, organized by video and with key points bolded:
Video 1: 2-Minute Rule to Learn Coding - Atomic Habits
â€¢ Many people watch online tutorials but do not progress towards becoming a software engineer.
â€¢ Learning to code can feel like a boring task, making it hard to stay motivated.
â€¢ The book Atomic Habits by James Clear discusses habit loops, environment priming, and using dopamine to stick to good habits.
â€¢ Small changes in direction can compound over time and lead to significant changes in outcomes.
â€¢ New programmers do not need to build revolutionary things to enter the tech industry; they need to take small steps every day.
â€¢ Building daily "atomic habits" is key to progress.
â€¢ Improvement in programming skills may not feel linear; there is often an initial "valley of disappointment" where progress is not apparent.
â€¢ Many people give up during this initial phase, but the returns for effort are delayed.
â€¢ After the initial phase, learning new languages, building projects, and getting jobs can feel natural.
â€¢ A "habit loop" consists of a cue, craving, response, and reward. 
â€¢ Bad habit example: Phone vibrates (cue), you crave to see the notification, you pick up the phone (response), and get a dopamine release from social media (reward).
â€¢ This loop can also be used to build good habits.
â€¢ To build a habit of learning programming: 
â€¢ Use your laptop as a cue, placing it in a visible location where you waste the most time.
â€¢ Use implementation intentions: attach a specific plan to your intention, such as "Every morning when the alarm goes off, I will do a programming lesson for 2 hours on my desk.".
â€¢ Stack habits by attaching the new habit to a current habit, such as "Right after I brush my teeth, I will do a programming lesson for 2 hours on my desk.".
â€¢ Dopamine is important for motivation. It is released during both good and bad actions. 
â€¢ Temptation bundling: tie an activity you want to do with something you already enjoy. For example, watch Netflix only while cycling above a certain speed.
â€¢ Write a program that tracks time spent in the code editor, which then controls time spent on your phone.
â€¢ The 2-minute rule: start with very small goals to make habit-building easier. 
â€¢ For example, commit to doing two programming exercises a day.
Video 2: 4 Habits That Will Make You a Better Programmer
â€¢ Habit 1: Start Developing 
â€¢ You need to start building something instead of just watching tutorials.
â€¢ Start with small projects like a calculator, a to-do app, or a simple HTML page.
â€¢ Errors and challenges will make you better.
â€¢ Team up with another beginner and learn from each other.
â€¢ Read other people's code to pick up techniques and patterns.
â€¢ Focus on building consistently rather than aiming for perfection in the beginning.
â€¢ Experience is the best teacher.
â€¢ Habit 2: Embrace Failures 
â€¢ Failures are inevitable, and do not reflect intelligence or ability.
â€¢ See failures as opportunities to learn and grow.
â€¢ Use Google to find solutions to problems.
â€¢ Take breaks to clear your mind.
â€¢ Don't be afraid to ask for help.
â€¢ Push forward when coding gets difficult instead of trying the next interesting thing.
â€¢ Every struggle builds coding muscles and problem-solving skills.
â€¢ Habit 3: Have Faith That Problems are Solvable 
â€¢ Experienced programmers believe every problem has a solution, even if not obvious.
â€¢ This faith is built through experience solving problems and debugging errors.
â€¢ With patience, persistence, and thinking, you'll find the path from "not working" to "working".
â€¢ Habit 4: Have a Growth Mindset 
â€¢ A growth mindset is the belief that intelligence and abilities are not fixed.
â€¢ Challenge yourself with projects outside of your comfort zone.
â€¢ A growth mindset makes you more adaptable to challenges.
â€¢ Embrace difficult problems to expand your skill set.
â€¢ Build a solid foundation before moving to advanced concepts.
â€¢ Get the "bigger picture" before diving into the details.
Video 3: 9 Programming Lessons I Wish I Knew Earlier
â€¢ Lesson 1: There's more to life than Big Tech. 
â€¢ Do not make landing a job at a big tech company your life goal.
â€¢ It is statistically harder to get a job at Google than to get accepted into Harvard.
â€¢ Big tech jobs may involve working on very specific parts of a large system.
â€¢ Smaller companies and startups may offer more diverse opportunities, more engaging work, and more fun.
â€¢ Reflect on why you got into programming; if it is about growth, smaller companies may be better.
â€¢ Lesson 2: Fundamentals are your best friend. 
â€¢ The fundamentals, such as variables, loops, data structures, and algorithms, are the building blocks of every coding project.
â€¢ Focus on understanding the basics before chasing the latest trends.
â€¢ Solidifying your grasp on fundamentals will "future-proof" your skills.
â€¢ Lesson 3: The importance of Real-World Experience. 
â€¢ The professional world is unlike college assignments; there are no predefined correct answers.
â€¢ You will often be presented with vague problems and expected to find solutions.
â€¢ Real-world experience is the best teacher.
â€¢ You will have to adapt, innovate, and improvise.
â€¢ Start small by diving into open-source projects, taking up freelancing, or finding any type of internship.
â€¢ Lesson 4: Network as much as you can. 
â€¢ Connections are as important as skills.
â€¢ Relationships offer shared knowledge, experience, and insights.
â€¢ Build genuine relationships rather than cold messaging professionals.
â€¢ Opportunities come from both what you know and who you know.
â€¢ Lesson 5: Imposter syndrome will happen to most of you. 
â€¢ Many people feel overshadowed by more experienced programmers.
â€¢ Recognize and acknowledge imposter syndrome; you are not alone with these doubts.
â€¢ Your path is uniquely yours.
â€¢ Lesson 6: Learn how to collaborate and work as a team. 
â€¢ Collaboration is as important as any programming language or framework.
â€¢ Master tools like version control.
â€¢ Develop soft skills, like communication and the ability to take feedback.
â€¢ Your ability to collaborate will define the impact you make.
â€¢ Lesson 7: Specialization versus generalization. 
â€¢ Start as a generalist by exploring various programming areas.
â€¢ Once you find your niche, start specializing and diving deep.
â€¢ Lesson 8: You'll always be a student. 
â€¢ The tech world is always evolving, so there is always something new to learn.
â€¢ Enjoy the journey and the opportunity to grow.
â€¢ Project-based learning helps you to learn and understand concepts.
â€¢ Projects present challenges that textbook exercises do not.
â€¢ Projects serve as evidence of your skills.
Video 4: How to build logics in programming
â€¢ It is common to struggle with logic building in programming.
â€¢ Simply practicing is not enough; specific steps must be followed.
â€¢ Step 1: Analyze the data flow. 
â€¢ It is important to understand how data is being passed and processed.
â€¢ Dry run (using pen and paper) to track the values of the data.
â€¢ Focus on the data flow instead of logic.
â€¢ Step 2: 90-10 Teaching 
â€¢ 90% of the work should be done by the teacher and 10% by the student.
â€¢ Teaching is different from a walkthrough.
â€¢ The teacher should give students precise tasks and monitor their progress.
â€¢ Self-learners often jump into a project without the necessary preparation.
â€¢ Start with a small part of a project and do your own 10% implementation.
â€¢ Step 3: To-do apps 
â€¢ Do not underestimate to-do apps; they are fundamental projects.
â€¢ Start with a basic to-do app and gradually add more functionality.
â€¢ To-do apps can be expanded with features like search, filtering, and database connections.
â€¢ Step 4: Add value 
â€¢ Start by adding your own value to tutorials or projects you have watched.
â€¢ For example, if you learned how to make a login page, try to make a register page.
â€¢ Add small features to build confidence.
Video 5: Learn To Code Like a GENIUS and Not Waste Time
â€¢ Learning to code is about problem-solving and continuous learning, not just programming languages.
â€¢ It is important to learn how to learn because: 
â€¢ Technology changes rapidly.
â€¢ Coding requires problem-solving.
â€¢ You must be adaptable to new challenges.
â€¢ You must be able to learn independently.
â€¢ It allows efficient learning.
â€¢ To start coding: 
â€¢ Determine what you want to make and why you want to code.
â€¢ What you want to make will guide your learning path.
â€¢ Why you want to code will motivate you when you encounter bugs.
â€¢ The programming language you should learn depends on your interests. 
â€¢ For web development: HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
â€¢ For mobile apps: Swift (iOS), Java or Kotlin (Android), or React Native/Flutter for both.
â€¢ For video games: Unity, GDau, or Unreal Engine.
â€¢ For AI and machine learning: Python.
â€¢ There are many resources available, including online courses, YouTube videos, books, and coding communities.
â€¢ Avoid "tutorial hell," which is consuming programming tutorials without applying the knowledge. 
â€¢ Instead, do project-based learning, applying what you've learned to real-world projects.
â€¢ Add to existing tutorials by building other features from scratch.
â€¢ Start with small projects, and then you will encounter real problems and learn to solve them.
â€¢ Speed up learning by sharing your progress online or finding a coding buddy.

â€¢ The number of lines of code you have written in your lifetime is directly related to the amount of logic you know.
Video 7: This is Why Programming Is Hard For you
â€¢ Programming involves logical thinking, problem-solving, and understanding the problem and tools, not just writing code.
â€¢ The "developer mindset" is what makes programming hard, not the coding itself.
â€¢ Knowing a programming language is like memorizing a recipe, but you need to understand the principles behind it.
â€¢ With a strong foundation, you can craft solutions from scratch instead of copying and pasting code.
â€¢ You need to develop your problem-solving and logical-thinking skills.
â€¢ Tutorials can show you how to do things, but you need to figure things out yourself.
â€¢ Tutorial hell is where you watch endless tutorials without being able to solve new problems.
â€¢ Tutorials are meant to be removed, like training wheels.
â€¢ To gain the programmer mindset: 
â€¢ Break down problems into smaller, more manageable tasks.
â€¢ Use project-based learning.
â€¢ Use the Feynman Technique: explain concepts in simple terms.
â€¢ Embrace failure as a learning tool.
â€¢ Practice regularly for a long period of time.
â€¢ Stop comparing yourself to other people.
Video 8: This video will change the way you think when coding
â€¢ Programmers make computers do things humans would not try, making it hard to think like a programmer.
â€¢ Humans might solve a problem by calculating the factorial, while programmers might start making all the possibilities from scratch.
â€¢ Programmers start with a small problem and build up to a larger one.
â€¢ Programming requires engaging your "slow brain" instead of your "fast brain." 
â€¢ The "fast" brain jumps to conclusions, while the "slow" brain requires analysis.
â€¢ Programming requires "first principles" thinking, which involves breaking down a complex problem into fundamental elements. 
â€¢ This involves breaking large problems down into smaller solvable ones.
â€¢ Modular programming is important, with separate functions for different tasks.
â€¢ Dynamic Programming (DP) also involves breaking a problem down.
â€¢ Senior engineers break problems into subproblems, while junior engineers work on small subproblems.
â€¢ Programmers build on the work of others. 
â€¢ You don't need to know everything, you need to know where to find it.
â€¢ There's a good chance that someone has already solved your problem.
â€¢ The programming world is constantly changing, and you must adapt to survive.
â€¢ "Become water my friend" means to be open-minded and constantly evolving.
