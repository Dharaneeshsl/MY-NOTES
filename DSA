DSA

The sources provide information on various Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) concepts, including algorithms, data structures, algorithmic thinking, and complexity analysis.
Algorithms
• An algorithm is a set of steps or instructions for completing a task.
• In computer science, an algorithm is a set of steps a program takes to finish a task.
• Algorithms follow specific guidelines, using the same steps to solve a problem each time it is faced.
• An algorithm must have a clear problem statement, specifying input and output.
• The steps in an algorithm need to be in a specific order and be distinct, not further breakable into subtasks.
• Algorithms should produce a result and complete in a finite amount of time.
• Executing the steps in an algorithm for a given input must result in the same output every time to be considered correct.
Algorithmic Thinking
• Algorithmic thinking involves breaking down a problem into a clearly defined input and output, along with a distinct set of steps to solve the problem.
• It involves understanding when to apply an algorithm by properly understanding the problem at hand.
• It's about breaking a problem into smaller problems, each with a defined input and output.
• It requires working through guidelines before rushing into solutions.
Data Structures
• A data structure is a way of storing data, including the format, relationships between values, and operations on the data.
• Arrays are a fundamental data structure that stores a collection of values, each referenced by an index or key. 
• In some languages, arrays are homogeneous, containing values of the same type, while in others, like Python, they can contain different types.
• Accessing elements in an array is a constant time operation.
• Inserting and deleting elements in arrays have a linear time complexity in the worst case.
• Linked lists are linear data structures where each element is in a separate object called a node. 
• A node models an individual item of data and a reference to the next node in the list.
• The first node is the head, and the last is the tail.
• Linked lists can be singly linked, with each node referencing only the next node, or doubly linked, with references to both the next and previous nodes.
• Inserting data into the head or tail of a linked list is more efficient than in an array.
• Nodes in a linked list are self-referential, meaning that the definition of a node includes a link to another node.
Complexity Analysis
• Big O notation is a theoretical way of defining the complexity of an algorithm as a function of the size of the input. 
• It simplifies complexity into a single variable, providing a big-picture view of performance.
• Big O is a notation that condenses data points and graphs down to one variable.
• It is used to describe both time and space complexity, particularly for comparing algorithms that solve the same problem.
• It measures complexity as the input size grows and is the upper bound of an algorithm, representing the worst-case scenario.
• Time complexity refers to how the runtime of an algorithm grows as the input size increases. 
• Common run times include constant time (O(1)), linear time (O(n)), logarithmic time (O(log n)), and quadratic time (O(n^2)).
• Constant time means the run time doesn't change with input size.
• Linear time means the run time grows linearly with the size of the input.
• Logarithmic time means that as the input size grows, the number of operations increases by a small factor.
• Quadratic time means that for a given value of n, the algorithm executes n squared number of operations.
• Quasi-linear time has a runtime between linear and quadratic, typically expressed as O(n log n).
• Exponential time has a runtime that grows exponentially with the input size and is generally very inefficient.
• Factorial time has a runtime that grows as a factorial of the input size and is very inefficient.
• The time complexity of an algorithm is usually determined by the least efficient step in the algorithm.
• Space complexity measures how much working or extra storage is needed as the algorithm grows. 
• It is measured in the worst-case scenario using Big O notation.
• It considers the additional storage required as the algorithm runs, not the initial input size.
• For example, the iterative version of binary search runs in constant space, while the recursive version of binary search runs in logarithmic space in Python.
• Merge sort has a linear space complexity (O(n)).
Specific Algorithms
• Linear Search: 
• Starts at the beginning of a list and compares each value to the target value.
• Has a time complexity of O(n).
• Binary Search: 
• Requires a sorted list.
• Repeatedly divides the search interval in half.
• Has a time complexity of O(log n).
• Merge Sort: 
• A sorting algorithm based on the divide and conquer approach, recursively breaking the problem into smaller subproblems until they are easily solved.
• Divides the list into sub-lists, recursively sorts sub-lists and merges them.
• Has a time complexity of O(n log n).
• Selection Sort 
• A sorting algorithm that finds the smallest element in a list, moves it to the beginning of a sorted list, and repeats until the entire list is sorted.
• Has a time complexity of O(n^2).
• Quick Sort 
• A sorting algorithm that uses a pivot element to partition a list into sublists, and then recursively sorts each sublist.
• Has a time complexity of O(n log n) on average, but O(n^2) in the worst case.
Recursion
• Recursion is a method where a function calls itself.
• A recursive function needs a base case or stopping condition and a recursive case that causes it to call itself.
• Recursive solutions can be less efficient than iterative solutions in some languages.
• The number of times a recursive function calls itself is called the recursive depth.
• Python has a maximum recursion depth.
• Tail call optimization can reduce the space complexity of recursion in some languages like Swift.
The sources provide a lot of information about discipline, focus, and concentration, offering various tools and techniques to improve these areas. 









What is an Algorithm?
An algorithm is a set of steps or instructions for completing a task [1]. It's like a recipe, a morning routine, or driving directions [1]. In computer science, it refers to the steps a program takes to finish a task [1].
• Key aspects of an algorithm:A clear problem statement with defined input and output [2, 3].
• A specific set of instructions in a particular order [2, 3].
• Each step must be clear and not further divisible into subtasks [2, 3].
• It should produce a result [2, 3].
• It should complete in a finite amount of time [3].
• Algorithmic thinking involves breaking a problem into smaller, manageable parts, each with a clearly defined input and output [4-6].
Why are Algorithms Important?
• Algorithms provide established solutions to common problems [1].
• Understanding algorithms helps you write more efficient code [4].
• They enable you to break down complex problems into distinct steps [4].
• They help in understanding complexity and efficiency in programming [4].
• Algorithmic thinking is a skill that is often tested in job interviews [4].
Linear Search
Linear search is a simple search algorithm that starts at the beginning of a list and checks each element until the target is found or the end of the list is reached [7].
• Definition:Start at the beginning of the list [7].
• Compare the current value to the target [7].
• If they match, the search is complete [7].
• If not, move to the next value and repeat step 2 [7].
• If the end of the list is reached, the target is not in the list [7].
• Python Implementation
def linear_search(list, target):
"""
Returns the position or the index position of the target if found, else returns None.
"""
for i in range(len(list)):
if list[i] == target:
return i
return None

numbers = [1, 2, 4, 7-9]
print(linear_search(numbers, 6))
#output: 5
• Time Complexity: Linear time, or O(n) [10, 11]. In the worst-case scenario, every element must be checked [10, 11].
Binary Search
Binary search is an algorithm that works on a sorted list. It repeatedly divides the search interval in half [12, 13].
• Definition:Find the middle element of the sorted list [12].
• If the middle element is the target, the search is complete [12].
• If the target is less than the middle element, search the left half [12].
• If the target is greater, search the right half [12].
• Repeat until the target is found or the list is empty [12].
• Python Implementation
def binary_search(list, target):
first = 0
last = len(list) - 1
while first <= last:
midpoint = (first + last) // 2
if list[midpoint] == target:
return midpoint
elif list[midpoint] < target:
first = midpoint + 1
else:
last = midpoint - 1
return None

numbers = [1-5, 7-9]
print(binary_search(numbers, 6))
#output: 5
• Time Complexity: Logarithmic time, or O(log n) [11, 14]. Each comparison halves the search space [11, 14].
• Recursive Binary Search:
• A recursive function calls itself within its definition [15].
• It requires a base case (stopping condition) to avoid infinite loops [16].
• def recursive_binary_search(list, target):
• if len(list) == 0:
• return False
• else:
• midpoint = len(list) // 2
• if list[midpoint] == target:
• return True
• else:
• if list[midpoint] < target:
• return recursive_binary_search(list[midpoint + 1:], target)
• else:
• return recursive_binary_search(list[:midpoint], target)

• numbers = [1-5, 7-9]
• print(recursive_binary_search(numbers, 6))
• #output: True
* **Time Complexity**: Logarithmic time, or O(log n).
* **Space Complexity**: Depends on implementation. Can be O(log n) due to function call stack in recursive implementations [17].

**Data Structures**

Data structures are ways of organizing and storing data in a computer, and they work hand-in-hand with algorithms [18, 19].

* **Arrays (Lists in Python)**
* Arrays store elements in contiguous memory locations [20, 21].
* They provide fast access to elements using indices, which is a constant time operation [20-22].
* Inserting or deleting elements in an array can be inefficient because it may require shifting other elements [23].

```python
new_list = [1, 4, 8]
result = new_list
print(result)
#output: 1
```
* **Linked Lists**
* A linked list consists of nodes, where each node contains data and a reference (or pointer) to the next node in the list [24].
* Unlike arrays, linked lists do not store elements in contiguous memory locations [24].
* Insertion and deletion at the beginning of a linked list can be done in constant time [25].

```python
class Node:
"""
An object for storing a single node of a linked list.
Models two attributes: data and the link to the next node in the list.
"""
def __init__(self, data):
self.data = data
self.next_node = None

def __repr__(self):
return f"Node({self.data})"

class LinkedList:
"""
An object for storing a linked list.
"""
def __init__(self):
self.head = None

def add(self, data):
new_node = Node(data)
new_node.next_node = self.head
self.head = new_node

def size(self):
"""
Returns the number of nodes in the list.
Takes linear time.
"""
current = self.head
count = 0
while current:
count += 1
current = current.next_node
return count

def search(self, key):
"""
Search for the first node containing data that matches the key.
Returns the node or None if not found.
Takes O(n) or linear time.
"""
current = self.head
while current:
if current.data == key:
return current
else:
current = current.next_node
return None

def insert(self, data, position):
"""
Inserts a new node containing data at index position.
Insertion takes constant time but finding the node at the insertion point takes linear time.
Therefore, it takes overall linear time.
"""
new_node = Node(data)
if position == 0:
new_node.next_node = self.head
self.head = new_node
return
current = self.head
while position > 1 and current.next_node:
current = current.next_node
position -=1
new_node.next_node = current.next_node
current.next_node = new_node

def __repr__(self):
nodes = []
current = self.head
while current:
nodes.append(str(current.data))
current = current.next_node
return "-> ".join(nodes)

l = LinkedList()
l.add(10)
l.add(20)
l.add(30)
l.insert(100,1)
print(l)
#output: 30-> 100-> 20-> 10
print(l.size())
#output: 4
print(l.search(20))
#output: Node(20)
```
* Singly linked lists have nodes that point to the next node only, while doubly linked lists have nodes pointing to both the next and previous nodes [24].
* Traversing a linked list to find a specific node or insert at a specific position can take linear time [23, 25, 26].

**Sorting Algorithms**

Sorting algorithms organize data in a specific order. The sources discuss several sorting algorithms:

* **Bogosort:**
* A very inefficient sorting algorithm that repeatedly randomizes the list until it is sorted [27].
* It has no practical use [27].
* **Selection Sort:**
* It repeatedly finds the minimum element from the unsorted part and puts it at the beginning [28].
* It is simple to implement but not very efficient for large lists [28].
* **Quicksort:**
* A recursive algorithm that picks a pivot value and splits the list into sublists of values less than or greater than the pivot [29, 30].
* It recursively sorts these sub-lists [30].
* It is generally more efficient than selection sort [30, 31].
* Its time complexity is typically O(n log n) [31].
* Implementation:
```python
def quicksort(list):
if len(list) <= 1:
return list

less_than_pivot = []
greater_than_pivot = []
pivot = list
for i in range(1, len(list)):
if list[i] <= pivot:
less_than_pivot.append(list[i])
else:
greater_than_pivot.append(list[i])

return quicksort(less_than_pivot) + [pivot] + quicksort(greater_than_pivot)

numbers = [15, 21, 26, 31-34]
print(quicksort(numbers))
#output: [15, 21, 26, 31-34]
```

* **Merge Sort:**
* A recursive algorithm that divides the list in half, recursively sorts each half, and then merges the sorted halves [31].
* It has a time complexity of O(n log n) [35].
* Implementation:
```python
def merge_sort(list):
"""
Sorts a list in ascending order.
Returns a new sorted list.
Merge sort has three main steps:
1. Divide: find the mid point of the list and divide into sub-lists.
2. Conquer: recursively sort the sub-lists created in previous step.
3. Combine: merge the sorted sub-lists created in previous step.
"""
if len(list) <= 1:
return list

left_half, right_half = split(list)
left = merge_sort(left_half)
right = merge_sort(right_half)
return merge(left, right)

def split(list):
"""
Divide the unsorted list at midpoint into sub lists.
Returns two sub-lists left and right.
"""
midpoint = len(list) // 2
left = list[:midpoint]
right = list[midpoint:]
return left, right

def merge(left, right):
"""
Merges two lists or arrays, sorting them in the process.
Returns a new merged list.
"""
l = []
i = 0
j = 0

while i < len(left) and j < len(right):
if left[i] < right[j]:
l.append(left[i])
i += 1
else:
l.append(right[j])
j += 1

while i < len(left):
l.append(left[i])
i += 1

while j < len(right):
l.append(right[j])
j += 1

return l

numbers = [15, 21, 26, 31-34]
print(merge_sort(numbers))
#output: [15, 21, 26, 31-34]
```
* **Merge Sort on Linked List:** The basic merge sort logic is the same, but the implementation is different because you must traverse a linked list by following references from one node to the next [36]. Instead of dividing a list by slicing, you divide by traversing, and instead of moving values, you move references between the linked list nodes [32, 36].

**Time and Space Complexity**

* **Time complexity** measures how the runtime of an algorithm grows as the input size (n) increases [17, 37].
* **Constant time**: O(1), the runtime doesn't change with input size [38].
* **Linear time**: O(n), the runtime increases proportionally to the input size [10, 11, 25, 38].
* **Logarithmic time**: O(log n), the runtime increases logarithmically with the input size [11, 14, 15].
* **n log n**: O(n log n), the runtime grows proportionally to the input size times the log of the input size [31, 35, 39].
* **Space complexity** measures how much extra memory an algorithm requires [17, 37]. It also uses Big O notation.
